    <h1>Java Minecraft Setup</h1>
    <p>After purchasing Minecraft: Java Edition on your Mojang account, it's time to set it up! First, download Minecraft and open it up. It may take a while to load. Then, go to settings and adjust it as you want. For slower devices, it is recommended that you use fast graphics and keep the render distance low. After you have finished adjusting the settings to your choosing, click play, create a survival world using the difficulty level of your choice, and let's begin! If you need more information about Minecraft's settings and controls, please click <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Controls">here</a>
