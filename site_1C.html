   <h3>Further Play</h3>
    <p>As you venture outside, keep a lookout for hostile mobs that have not died from the sunlight yet or despawned. If you see an enderman or a creeper, avoid it at all costs. If you have a sword, you can engage any leftover zombies, skeletons, or spiders if you wish, but it's recommended that you do not fight too much in order to prevent your hunger bar from going down too quickly. If you haven't eaten yet, be sure to do so; an empty hunger bar means death at higher difficulty levels and a weakened state at lower difficulty levels. 
    <p>While you are outside, try to gather wheat seeds by breaking tall grass. You can use these seeds to start a wheat farm or lure chickens at a later time. Considering the fact that this is your second day on the world and you need to obtain a steady supply of food quickly, the latter option will be able to fulfill your objective in a shorter amount of time. Furthermore, chop down any trees you see for wood. If it seems like there aren't many trees around, try to pick up the saplings as well and replant them. 
    <p>When you return to your shelter, craft some of your logs into wood planks and sticks, and craft the wood planks and sticks into fences and a fence gate. Make a pen using the fences and fence gate. Then, look for some chickens. Use the seeds you gathered earlier to lure them back to base and into your pen. Use the seeds to make the chickens breed. When entering and leaving the pen, be sure to open and close the fence gate quickly; you don't want the chickens escaping. Make sure to breed the chickens often. When the pen approaches full capacity, kill some of the chickens, and cook the chicken meat using your furance. From here, you can start to develop another source of food, such as a wheat farm. 
    <p>After you have established a steady source of food, you can look for a cave or dig and make your own mine. Bring torches, a stone pickaxe, some food, and a sword. Using your stone pickaxe, mine for any iron and coal you find. Be sure to light up the cave/mine with torches-you don't want hostile mobs to spawn and attack you! When your stone pickaxe breaks, return to base with your coal and iron ore. Using your furance and coal, smelt the iron ore into iron ingots. Craft a bucket, an iron pickaxe, and an iron sword. With enough mining trips, you'll have enough iron to make yourself a full set of iron tools and iron armor. By then, you can start splunking for diamonds.
