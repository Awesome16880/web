    <h1>Java Minecraft Setup</h1>
    <p>After purchasing Minecraft: Java Edition on your Mojang account, it's time to set it up! First, download Minecraft and open it up. It may take a while to load. Then, go to settings and adjust it as you want. For slower devices, it is recommended that you use fast graphics and keep the render distance low. After you have finished adjusting the settings to your choosing, click play, create a survival world using the difficulty level of your choice, and let's begin!

    <h2>Survival: First Day Tips</h2>
    <p>Note: A full Minecraft days lasts approximately twenty minutes. Ten minutes of this time is daytime, and about eight minutes is nighttime. There are two transitions in between daytime and nighttime: sunset and sunrise. Each lasts around one minute.
    <p>After you spawn into the world, look around for trees. If there are any, walk towards them and punch the tree blocks to get wood. If there are not any, build a landmark near your spawn point pointing towards any direction of your choosing. Then, travel in this direction. If you spawn on an island without any resources whatsoever, then you'll have to swim until you reach a land mass that does have resources. 
    <p>Collect at least ten tree logs from the trees. Make a crafting table. Then, use the crafting table and your wooden materials to craft some wood planks, a wooden axe, and a wooden pickaxe. Use the axe to cut down more trees to get more tree logs. When you're ready to move on, make sure you break your crafting table and put it back into your inventory. Any and all resources you get at this stage of the game will be extremely important-so don't lose or leave behind anything! If you come across any pigs, cows, chickens, rabbits, or sheep, kill all but two of each type. (This is because you need at least two animals of the same species in order to get more animals of the same species via breeding). Try to remember where you leave behind these said animals. They can be very useful in the days to come.
    <p>To get stone, you can either look for a cave, or you can just dig down. (Do NOT ever dig straight down! Instead, try to create a 1x2 hole, where you stand on one side and dig down the other side. If the other side seems safe, hop down. If not, at least you didn't dig straight down into danger.) Use your pickaxe to mine the stone. Look for coal ore if there is any, and mine it. It is recommended that you craft a stone pickaxe, as a stone pickaxe can mine faster and can last longer. Furthermore, the stone pickaxe will allow you to mine iron ore. If you mine enough stone, try to craft a furnace and a stone sword for protection.
    <p>While you are doing all of this, be sure to keep an eye on the sun. When the sun starts to set, make sure you find or build some shelter. If you are unable to do either of these things, then dig down three blocks, hop in if it's safe, and place a dirt block over the entrance of the hole you just dug. You can safely remain here until the night passes. If you managed to find some shelter (say, a cave), make sure you craft some torches and light up your surroundings. You do not want to come face-to-face with a hostile mob, especially if you have not crafted a sword at this point. If you managed to build a shelter, then remember to light up the interior of the shelter and the outside vicinity in order to ensure hostile mobs do not spawn nearby. If you managed to obtain three wool blocks of the same color and some wood planks, then you can craft a bed. Place down the bed and sleep in it to skip the night (and the scary hostile mobs) all together. If you can't craft a bed, then you can place down your furance. If you managed to obtain any meat and your hunger bar is low, use your spare coal and furance to cook it, and then eat the cooked meat. If you don't have any spare coal, then you can make some charcoal by cooking some wood logs. Charcoal is an effective substitute for coal.
    <p>When the sun rises, you can safely exit your shelter and begin your second day. For further reading, click <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Your_first_10_minutes">here</a>
    <h3>Further Play</h3>
    <p>As you venture outside, keep a lookout for hostile mobs that have not died from the sunlight yet or despawned. If you see an enderman or a creeper, avoid it at all costs. If you have a sword, you can engage any leftover zombies, skeletons, or spiders if you wish, but it's recommended that you do not fight too much in order to prevent your hunger bar from going down too quickly. If you haven't eaten yet, be sure to do so; an empty hunger bar means death at higher difficulty levels and a weakened state at lower difficulty levels. 
    <p>While you are outside, try to gather wheat seeds by breaking tall grass. You can use these seeds to start a wheat farm or lure chickens at a later time. Considering the fact that this is your second day on the world and you need to obtain a steady supply of food quickly, the latter option will be able to fulfill your objective in a shorter amount of time. Furthermore, chop down any trees you see for wood. If it seems like there aren't many trees around, try to pick up the saplings as well and replant them. 
    <p>When you return to your shelter, craft some of your logs into wood planks and sticks, and craft the wood planks and sticks into fences and a fence gate. Make a pen using the fences and fence gate. Then, look for some chickens. Use the seeds you gathered earlier to lure them back to base and into your pen. Use the seeds to make the chickens breed. When entering and leaving the pen, be sure to open and close the fence gate quickly; you don't want the chickens escaping. Make sure to breed the chickens often. When the pen approaches full capacity, kill some of the chickens, and cook the chicken meat using your furance. From here, you can start to develop another source of food, such as a wheat farm. 
    <p>After you have established a steady source of food, you can look for a cave or dig and make your own mine. Bring torches, a stone pickaxe, some food, and a sword. Using your stone pickaxe, mine for any iron and coal you find. Be sure to light up the cave/mine with torches-you don't want hostile mobs to spawn and attack you! When your stone pickaxe breaks, return to base with your coal and iron ore. Using your furance and coal, smelt the iron ore into iron ingots. Craft a bucket, an iron pickaxe, and an iron sword. With enough mining trips, you'll have enough iron to make yourself a full set of iron tools and iron armor. By then, you can start splunking for diamonds.
