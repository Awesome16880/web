    <h1>Survival: First Day Tips</h1>
    <p>Note: A full Minecraft days lasts approximately twenty minutes. Ten minutes of this time is daytime, and about eight minutes is nighttime. There are two transitions in between daytime and nighttime: sunset and sunrise. Each lasts around one minute.
    <p>After you spawn into the world, look around for trees. If there are any, walk towards them and punch the tree blocks to get wood. If there are not any, build a landmark near your spawn point pointing towards any direction of your choosing. Then, travel in this direction. If you spawn on an island without any resources whatsoever, then you'll have to swim until you reach a land mass that does have resources. 
    <p>Collect at least ten tree logs from the trees. Make a crafting table. Then, use the crafting table and your wooden materials to craft some wood planks, a wooden axe, and a wooden pickaxe. Use the axe to cut down more trees to get more tree logs. When you're ready to move on, make sure you break your crafting table and put it back into your inventory. Any and all resources you get at this stage of the game will be extremely important-so don't lose or leave behind anything! If you come across any pigs, cows, chickens, rabbits, or sheep, kill all but two of each type. (This is because you need at least two animals of the same species in order to get more animals of the same species via breeding). Try to remember where you leave behind these said animals. They can be very useful in the days to come.
    <p>To get stone, you can either look for a cave, or you can just dig down. (Do NOT ever dig straight down! Instead, try to create a 1x2 hole, where you stand on one side and dig down the other side. If the other side seems safe, hop down. If not, at least you didn't dig straight down into danger.) Use your pickaxe to mine the stone. Look for coal ore if there is any, and mine it. It is recommended that you craft a stone pickaxe, as a stone pickaxe can mine faster and can last longer. Furthermore, the stone pickaxe will allow you to mine iron ore. If you mine enough stone, try to craft a furnace and a stone sword for protection.
    <p>While you are doing all of this, be sure to keep an eye on the sun. When the sun starts to set, make sure you find or build some shelter. If you are unable to do either of these things, then dig down three blocks, hop in if it's safe, and place a dirt block over the entrance of the hole you just dug. You can safely remain here until the night passes. If you managed to find some shelter (say, a cave), make sure you craft some torches and light up your surroundings. You do not want to come face-to-face with a hostile mob, especially if you have not crafted a sword at this point. If you managed to build a shelter, then remember to light up the interior of the shelter and the outside vicinity in order to ensure hostile mobs do not spawn nearby. If you managed to obtain three wool blocks of the same color and some wood planks, then you can craft a bed. Place down the bed and sleep in it to skip the night (and the scary hostile mobs) all together. If you can't craft a bed, then you can place down your furance. If you managed to obtain any meat and your hunger bar is low, use your spare coal and furance to cook it, and then eat the cooked meat. If you don't have any spare coal, then you can make some charcoal by cooking some wood logs. Charcoal is an effective substitute for coal.
    <p>When the sun rises, you can safely exit your shelter and begin your second day. For further reading, click <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Your_first_10_minutes">here</a>
