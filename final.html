		<h1>Games and Results</h1>
		<h2>By: Nelson So (Period 4)
		<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>My project consists of 2 single-player games and a kind of tracker. The two games are
				Rock, Paper, Scissors and Blackjack. The tracker produces a bar graph based upon the results of
				your Rock, Paper, Scissors results. </p>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<p>The file I submitted contains 2 separate files that are meant to be run separately. I was unable
			to make a zip file, so I decided to mark each file with a comment instead. I had mentioned so in a comment
			on my submission on the HW server.</p>
			<p>When you run Rock, Paper, Scissors, there will be a prompt asking you if you want to play. Simply enter any value. 
			Then, proceed play according to the instructions: you will be asked to enter a choice. After entering a choice, you will be
			given a result. Continue playing until you don't want to. Then, simply enter "quit" when prompted, and your overall results
			will be brought to you in the form of a bar graph. </p>
			<p>When you run Blackjack, you will be automatically dealt a hand. Simply hit H for a hit or S to stand. If you need help
			on how to play Blackjack, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">here</a>. (Please note that my version of Blackjack
			only allows hitting and standing. There are no things like side bets or insurance.)
			</p>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
			<p>Both games will require an input from the play. Simply follow the prompts and instructions, and try your best not to put in unacceptable or 
			incorrect values.</p>
			<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors takes an input (rock, paper, or scissors) from the player. Then, the program will randomly select rock, paper, or scissors. The 
			results are then compared. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and the program select the same thing, it's a 
			tie. Then, the result is added into the player's win, loss, or tie count (depending on the result). When the player decides to quit, a bar graph will be produced that
				shows the player how many wins, losses, and ties they obtained.</p>
			<p>Blackjack generates a deck and then randomly selects 2 cards for the player and 2 for the dealer. The player then plays Blackjack according to the rules. Unfortunately, 
			my version of Blackjack only allows hitting and standing as the only options. If the player hits, a card is given to them, and its value is added on to the player's score. If 
				the player decides to stand, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer will hit if they have a score lower than 17, and the dealer will stand when they have 17 or higher. Then, the 
				scores of the player and dealer are compared. The higher score wins!</p>
		<h3>Files</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>cs_project_6-6-2020: The main file containing both games (When I made the file, I had written in the wrong year. Oops!)</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p>The following resources were used to aid me in developing the games.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Link to rock paper scissors: Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Link to blackjack: Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>List of Bugs, Errors, and Things to Be Aware Of</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When you run Rock, Paper, Scissors and you try to quit, the bar graph that shows you your results will show up. However,
				you may have some difficulty in closing it, because when I tried to X out the bar graph after I was done seeing it, it simply 
				re-appeared. In order to solve this issue after running the program on Thonny, you need to click the STOP button on Thonny. (It's 
				basically the small red button near the small green button that you would click to run a program.)</li>
				<li>There shouldn't be anything wrong with the Blackjack program.</li>
			</ul>
